This module adds some new features to account module, including:
- Automatic partner account creation, update and removal (Configurable per company).
- Avoids duplicate supplier invoices by checking no other invoice has the same partner, date and reference when the user tries to create the invoice.
- Allows searching draft account moves by adding the corresponding '*' before the ID.
- Ensures both Journal and Period are always consistent among account move and all its move lines. If the user changes Journal or Period in a move the change will be propagated to all lines and vice-versa.
- Makes 'date_due' field in invoices readonly when payment_term is set.
- Allows grouping invoice lines that have different products into the same account move line. (Configurable per journal).
- Allows ensuring new invoices do not have a date previous to the latest invoice in the journal, as required by the law of some countries such as Spain. (Configurable per journal).
- Ensures account moves created from bank statements use the sequence of the journal instead of keeping statement's numbering.
- Allows ensuring all moves of a given account have a partner associated with them.
